# f5C-finder
## Introduction
f5C-finder is the first neural network-based model for the identification on 5‑Formylcytidine modifications on mRNA.
this repository is the offical tensorflow vision of f5C-finder with all the codes used in the paper:  
f5C-finder: combining language model with multi-head attention for predicting 5‑Formylcytidine modifications on mRNA
## Webserver with GUI
Your can use f5C-finder for inference at [our webserver](http://f5c.m6aminer.cn/)
, submitted data will be kept confidential.

## env
make sure your tensorflow > 2.0
